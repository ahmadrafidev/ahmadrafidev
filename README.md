## A little things about Me

I build digital products that feel right and work beautifully. A product engineer based in Jakarta, finishing my Computer Science degree at Universitas Indonesia. I create products that solve real problems through thoughtful design and clean code.

I've rebuilt chat platforms serving thousands at healthtech startups and designed internal tools that save development teams hours weekly. I focus on the intersection of engineering precision and design intuition: making complex things simple and ensuring the best details are invisible. I'm driven by the goal of making products work so well they feel inevitable.
