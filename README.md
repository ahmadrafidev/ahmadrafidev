## A little things about Me

A product engineer based in Jakarta who builds digital products that feel intuitive and work beautifully. Currently finishing my Computer Science degree at Universitas Indonesia, I specialize in creating solutions that solve real problems through thoughtful design and clean code.

My experience spans rebuilding chat platforms that serve thousands of users at healthtech startups and designing internal tools that save development teams hours each week. I thrive at the intersection of engineering precision and design intuitionâ€”taking complex problems and making them simple, ensuring the best details remain invisible to users.

What drives me is creating products that work so seamlessly they feel inevitable. I believe the mark of great engineering is when technology disappears and users can focus entirely on what they're trying to accomplish.
